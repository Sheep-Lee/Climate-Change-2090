# Inspired by that Grammarly ad


Writing's not that easy.
That's why future me is here to help.
This code is grammatically correct,
but it's wordy and hard to read

Future me's cutting edge brain helps past me craft compelling,
understandable writing that makes an impact on your reader.
Much better.
