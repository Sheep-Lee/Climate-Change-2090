Writing's not that easy.
That's why future me is here to help.
This code is grammatically correct,
but it's wordy and hard to read
It undermines the writer's message
and the word choice is bland.
Future me's cutting edge brain helps past me craft compelling,
understandable writing that makes an impact on your reader.
Much better.
